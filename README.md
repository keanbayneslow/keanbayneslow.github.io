# My Personal Website

## Requirements

This project is an opportunity to showcase what you've learned so far, so it is important that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are incorporated into the project in some way. For example, you could use a mouseover event to change the appearance of an element when the user mouses over it. Or use a click event to toggle some content between being visible and hidden. There are a variety of ways to do this using the CSS and JavaScript you've learned so far, but don't forget you can always use Google if you get stuck. Google is an invaluable tool for developers! Try to use this project as an opportunity to stretch your coding skills!

The content, styling, and functionality of your site are up to you. Keep in mind that you may show this project to your peers and future instructors, so be considerate of content/subject matter and your potential audience.

## Process and Design Choices

### Minimalist Theme

### User Greeting

To practice using JavaScript, I wanted to add some functionality for my personal website to greet the user once they input their name. I wanted this to be simple and inkeeping with the minimalist theme. (INSERT CODE SNIPPETS AND SCREENSHOTS).

### Light and Dark Theme
