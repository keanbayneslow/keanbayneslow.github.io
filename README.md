# My Personal Website

This is my very first attempt at making a personal webpage/portfolio using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Below I have attempted, in-part (removing the tears, and blank stares at the screen), to describe my process, learning and hopefully the future development of this page as my skills and knowledge increase.

## Requirements - AcademyXi

This project is an opportunity to showcase what you've learned so far, so it is important that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are incorporated into the project in some way. For example, you could use a mouseover event to change the appearance of an element when the user mouses over it. Or use a click event to toggle some content between being visible and hidden. There are a variety of ways to do this using the CSS and JavaScript you've learned so far, but don't forget you can always use Google if you get stuck. Google is an invaluable tool for developers! Try to use this project as an opportunity to stretch your coding skills!

The content, styling, and functionality of your site are up to you. Keep in mind that you may show this project to your peers and future instructors, so be considerate of content/subject matter and your potential audience.
